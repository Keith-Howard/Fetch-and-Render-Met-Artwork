# Road Map
Improvements I would make are to not show all pagination on the screen, to put a prev and next buttons with several page numbers between them. That would allow me to make the data on each page smaller without having to have many pagination buttons at the bottom of the page. I would also create an alert that would tell you if no results come back.
